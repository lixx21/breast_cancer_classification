# breast_cancer_classification

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breast cancer is one of a dangerous disease in the world. In my country, Indonesia there are more than 150 thousand cases per year. Therefore we need to predict is the breast cancer determine as benign or malignant to help doctor to give more efficient solution to patient. In this case we will use machine learning model to predict is the breast cancer benign or malignant ?.

# Dataset

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dataset, I used [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dataset contains 33 features and 569 records, and you can see the detail information from that link about the dataset.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this step I need to explore more about the dataset, therefore I know more about the dataset. this is the steps that I have done:

1. I am looking the information of the dataset about what is the data type for each of features, how much the features we had, and how much records that we had,
2. I am checking the statistical information about the features that contains numerical values,
3. I am checking about the null or missing values in the dataset, missing values can be an important thing that we must handle because it can impact to our model's peformacne, fortunately that this dataset has no missing values,
